## Paternal Halfsibling  analysis tool

This tool can be used for finding common haplotypes in paternal halfsiblings.

# Step 1: Preprocess Data

Carry out QC on halfsib data (plink --maf --mind --geno)

# Step 2: Annotate genome correctly


# Step 1: Finding the Paternal Haplotypes and Annotating Homozygous Loci

Input: file with haplotype data for parents and offspring 

The first step includes finding the common paternal haplotypes based on
